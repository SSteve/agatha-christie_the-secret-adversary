    <p>
      Sir James brushed past Julius and hurriedly bent over the fallen woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heart,&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;Seeing us so suddenly must have given her a
      shock. Brandy&mdash;and quickly, or she&rsquo;ll slip through our fingers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julius hurried to the washstand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not there,&rdquo; said Tuppence over her shoulder. &ldquo;In the tantalus in the
      dining-room. Second door down the passage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Between them Sir James and Tuppence lifted Mrs. Vandemeyer and carried her
      to the bed. There they dashed water on her face, but with no result. The
      lawyer fingered her pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Touch and go,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I wish that young fellow would hurry up with
      the brandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Julius re-entered the room, carrying a glass half full of
      the spirit which he handed to Sir James. While Tuppence lifted her head
      the lawyer tried to force a little of the spirit between her closed lips.
      Finally the woman opened her eyes feebly. Tuppence held the glass to her
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vandemeyer complied. The brandy brought the colour back to her white
      cheeks, and revived her in a marvellous fashion. She tried to sit up&mdash;then
      fell back with a groan, her hand to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my heart,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lay back with closed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir James kept his finger on her wrist a minute longer, then withdrew it
      with a nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll do now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All three moved away, and stood together talking in low voices. One and
      all were conscious of a certain feeling of anticlimax. Clearly any scheme
      for cross-questioning the lady was out of the question for the moment. For
      the time being they were baffled, and could do nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuppence related how Mrs. Vandemeyer had declared herself willing to
      disclose the identity of Mr. Brown, and how she had consented to discover
      and reveal to them the whereabouts of Jane Finn. Julius was
      congratulatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Miss Tuppence. Splendid! I guess that hundred thousand
      pounds will look just as good in the morning to the lady as it did over
      night. There&rsquo;s nothing to worry over. She won&rsquo;t speak without the cash
      anyway, you bet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was certainly a good deal of common sense in this, and Tuppence felt
      a little comforted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you say is true,&rdquo; said Sir James meditatively. &ldquo;I must confess,
      however, that I cannot help wishing we had not interrupted at the minute
      we did. Still, it cannot be helped, it is only a matter of waiting until
      the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked across at the inert figure on the bed. Mrs. Vandemeyer lay
      perfectly passive with closed eyes. He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tuppence, with an attempt at cheerfulness, &ldquo;we must wait
      until the morning, that&rsquo;s all. But I don&rsquo;t think we ought to leave the
      flat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about leaving that bright boy of yours on guard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Albert? And suppose she came round again and hooked it. Albert couldn&rsquo;t
      stop her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess she won&rsquo;t want to make tracks away from the dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She might. She seemed very frightened of &lsquo;Mr. Brown.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Real plumb scared of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She looked round and said even walls had ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe she meant a dictaphone,&rdquo; said Julius with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Tuppence is right,&rdquo; said Sir James quietly. &ldquo;We must not leave the
      flat&mdash;if only for Mrs. Vandemeyer&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julius stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think he&rsquo;d get after her? Between now and to-morrow morning. How
      could he know, even?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget your own suggestion of a dictaphone,&rdquo; said Sir James dryly.
      &ldquo;We have a very formidable adversary. I believe, if we exercise all due
      care, that there is a very good chance of his being delivered into our
      hands. But we must neglect no precaution. We have an important witness,
      but she must be safeguarded. I would suggest that Miss Tuppence should go
      to bed, and that you and I, Mr. Hersheimmer, should share the vigil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tuppence was about to protest, but happening to glance at the bed she saw
      Mrs. Vandemeyer, her eyes half-open, with such an expression of mingled
      fear and malevolence on her face that it quite froze the words on her
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she wondered whether the faint and the heart attack had been
      a gigantic sham, but remembering the deadly pallor she could hardly credit
      the supposition. As she looked the expression disappeared as by magic, and
      Mrs. Vandemeyer lay inert and motionless as before. For a moment the girl
      fancied she must have dreamt it. But she determined nevertheless to be on
      the alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Julius, &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;d better make a move out of here any
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The others fell in with his suggestion. Sir James again felt Mrs.
      Vandemeyer&rsquo;s pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly satisfactory,&rdquo; he said in a low voice to Tuppence. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be
      absolutely all right after a night&rsquo;s rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl hesitated a moment by the bed. The intensity of the expression
      she had surprised had impressed her powerfully. Mrs. Vandemeyer lifted her
      lids. She seemed to be struggling to speak. Tuppence bent over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;leave&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she seemed unable to proceed, murmuring
      something that sounded like &ldquo;sleepy.&rdquo; Then she tried again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuppence bent lower still. It was only a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr.&mdash;Brown&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The voice stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the half-closed eyes seemed still to send an agonized message.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moved by a sudden impulse, the girl said quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t leave the flat. I shall sit up all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flash of relief showed before the lids descended once more. Apparently
      Mrs. Vandemeyer slept. But her words had awakened a new uneasiness in
      Tuppence. What had she meant by that low murmur: &ldquo;Mr. Brown?&rdquo; Tuppence
      caught herself nervously looking over her shoulder. The big wardrobe
      loomed up in a sinister fashion before her eyes. Plenty of room for a man
      to hide in that.... Half-ashamed of herself, Tuppence pulled it open and
      looked inside. No one&mdash;of course! She stooped down and looked under
      the bed. There was no other possible hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuppence gave her familiar shake of the shoulders. It was absurd, this
      giving way to nerves! Slowly she went out of the room. Julius and Sir
      James were talking in a low voice. Sir James turned to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lock the door on the outside, please, Miss Tuppence, and take out the
      key. There must be no chance of anyone entering that room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gravity of his manner impressed them, and Tuppence felt less ashamed
      of her attack of &ldquo;nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; remarked Julius suddenly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s Tuppence&rsquo;s bright boy. I guess
      I&rsquo;d better go down and ease his young mind. That&rsquo;s some lad, Tuppence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get in, by the way?&rdquo; asked Tuppence suddenly. &ldquo;I forgot to
      ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Albert got me on the phone all right. I ran round for Sir James
      here, and we came right on. The boy was on the look out for us, and was
      just a mite worried about what might have happened to you. He&rsquo;d been
      listening outside the door of the flat, but couldn&rsquo;t hear anything. Anyhow
      he suggested sending us up in the coal lift instead of ringing the bell.
      And sure enough we landed in the scullery and came right along to find
      you. Albert&rsquo;s still below, and must be just hopping mad by this time.&rdquo;
       With which Julius departed abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, Miss Tuppence,&rdquo; said Sir James, &ldquo;you know this place better
      than I do. Where do you suggest we should take up our quarters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tuppence considered for a moment or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Mrs. Vandemeyer&rsquo;s boudoir would be the most comfortable,&rdquo; she
      said at last, and led the way there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir James looked round approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will do very well, and now, my dear young lady, do go to bed and get
      some sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tuppence shook her head resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t, thank you, Sir James. I should dream of Mr. Brown all night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll be so tired, child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;d rather stay up&mdash;really.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer gave in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julius reappeared some minutes later, having reassured Albert and rewarded
      him lavishly for his services. Having in his turn failed to persuade
      Tuppence to go to bed, he said decisively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, you&rsquo;ve got to have something to eat right away. Where&rsquo;s the
      larder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tuppence directed him, and he returned in a few minutes with a cold pie
      and three plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a hearty meal, the girl felt inclined to pooh-pooh her fancies of
      half an hour before. The power of the money bribe could not fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Miss Tuppence,&rdquo; said Sir James, &ldquo;we want to hear your
      adventures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Julius.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuppence narrated her adventures with some complacence. Julius
      occasionally interjected an admiring &ldquo;Bully.&rdquo; Sir James said nothing until
      she had finished, when his quiet &ldquo;well done, Miss Tuppence,&rdquo; made her
      flush with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I don&rsquo;t get clearly,&rdquo; said Julius. &ldquo;What put her up to
      clearing out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; confessed Tuppence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir James stroked his chin thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The room was in great disorder. That looks as though her flight was
      unpremeditated. Almost as though she got a sudden warning to go from some
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Brown, I suppose,&rdquo; said Julius scoffingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer looked at him deliberately for a minute or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Remember, you yourself have once been worsted by
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julius flushed with vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel just mad when I think of how I handed out Jane&rsquo;s photograph to him
      like a lamb. Gee, if I ever lay hands on it again, I&rsquo;ll freeze on to it
      like&mdash;like hell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That contingency is likely to be a remote one,&rdquo; said the other dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Julius frankly. &ldquo;And, in any case, it&rsquo;s the
      original I&rsquo;m out after. Where do you think she can be, Sir James?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible to say. But I&rsquo;ve a very good idea where she <i>has</i> been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have? Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir James smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the scene of your nocturnal adventures, the Bournemouth nursing home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There? Impossible. I asked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear sir, you asked if anyone of the name of Jane Finn had been
      there. Now, if the girl had been placed there it would almost certainly be
      under an assumed name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully for you,&rdquo; cried Julius. &ldquo;I never thought of that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was fairly obvious,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the doctor&rsquo;s in it too,&rdquo; suggested Tuppence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julius shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. I took to him at once. No, I&rsquo;m pretty sure Dr. Hall&rsquo;s
      all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hall, did you say?&rdquo; asked Sir James. &ldquo;That is curious&mdash;really very
      curious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; demanded Tuppence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I happened to meet him this morning. I&rsquo;ve known him slightly on
      and off for some years, and this morning I ran across him in the street.
      Staying at the <i>Métropole</i>, he told me.&rdquo; He turned to Julius. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he
      tell you he was coming up to town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julius shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curious,&rdquo; mused Sir James. &ldquo;You did not mention his name this afternoon,
      or I would have suggested your going to him for further information with
      my card as introduction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m a mutt,&rdquo; said Julius with unusual humility. &ldquo;I ought to have
      thought of the false name stunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you think of anything after falling out of that tree?&rdquo; cried
      Tuppence. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure anyone else would have been killed right off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess it doesn&rsquo;t matter now, anyway,&rdquo; said Julius. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
      Mrs. Vandemeyer on a string, and that&rsquo;s all we need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tuppence, but there was a lack of assurance in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence settled down over the party. Little by little the magic of the
      night began to gain a hold on them. There were sudden creaks of the
      furniture, imperceptible rustlings in the curtains. Suddenly Tuppence
      sprang up with a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. I know Mr. Brown&rsquo;s somewhere in the flat! I can <i>feel</i>
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, Tuppence, how could he be? This door&rsquo;s open into the hall. No one
      could have come in by the front door without our seeing and hearing him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. I <i>feel</i> he&rsquo;s here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked appealingly at Sir James, who replied gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With due deference to your feelings, Miss Tuppence (and mine as well for
      that matter), I do not see how it is humanly possible for anyone to be in
      the flat without our knowledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl was a little comforted by his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sitting up at night is always rather jumpy,&rdquo; she confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sir James. &ldquo;We are in the condition of people holding a
      séance. Perhaps if a medium were present we might get some marvellous
      results.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe in spiritualism?&rdquo; asked Tuppence, opening her eyes wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is some truth in it, without a doubt. But most of the testimony
      would not pass muster in the witness-box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hours drew on. With the first faint glimmerings of dawn, Sir James
      drew aside the curtains. They beheld, what few Londoners see, the slow
      rising of the sun over the sleeping city. Somehow, with the coming of the
      light, the dreads and fancies of the past night seemed absurd. Tuppence&rsquo;s
      spirits revived to the normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a gorgeous day. And we shall find
      Tommy. And Jane Finn. And everything will be lovely. I shall ask Mr.
      Carter if I can&rsquo;t be made a Dame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At seven o&rsquo;clock Tuppence volunteered to go and make some tea. She
      returned with a tray, containing the teapot and four cups.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the other cup for?&rdquo; inquired Julius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prisoner, of course. I suppose we might call her that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taking her tea seems a kind of anticlimax to last night,&rdquo; said Julius
      thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it does,&rdquo; admitted Tuppence. &ldquo;But, anyway, here goes. Perhaps you&rsquo;d
      both come, too, in case she springs on me, or anything. You see, we don&rsquo;t
      know what mood she&rsquo;ll wake up in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir James and Julius accompanied her to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the key? Oh, of course, I&rsquo;ve got it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put it in the lock, and turned it, then paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposing, after all, she&rsquo;s escaped?&rdquo; she murmured in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plumb impossible,&rdquo; replied Julius reassuringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sir James said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuppence drew a long breath and entered. She heaved a sigh of relief as
      she saw that Mrs. Vandemeyer was lying on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; she remarked cheerfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought you some tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vandemeyer did not reply. Tuppence put down the cup on the table by
      the bed and went across to draw up the blinds. When she turned, Mrs.
      Vandemeyer still lay without a movement. With a sudden fear clutching at
      her heart, Tuppence ran to the bed. The hand she lifted was cold as
      ice.... Mrs. Vandemeyer would never speak now....
    </p>
    <p>
      Her cry brought the others. A very few minutes sufficed. Mrs. Vandemeyer
      was dead&mdash;must have been dead some hours. She had evidently died in
      her sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that isn&rsquo;t the cruellest luck,&rdquo; cried Julius in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer was calmer, but there was a curious gleam in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is luck,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think&mdash;but, say, that&rsquo;s plumb impossible&mdash;no one
      could have got in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted the lawyer. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how they could. And yet&mdash;she
      is on the point of betraying Mr. Brown, and&mdash;she dies. Is it only
      chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, <i>how!</i> That is what we must find out.&rdquo; He stood there silently, gently
      stroking his chin. &ldquo;We must find out,&rdquo; he said quietly, and Tuppence felt
      that if she was Mr. Brown she would not like the tone of those simple
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julius&rsquo;s glance went to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The window&rsquo;s open,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Do you think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tuppence shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The balcony only goes along as far as the boudoir. We were there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might have slipped out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; suggested Julius.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sir James interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Brown&rsquo;s methods are not so crude. In the meantime we must send for a
      doctor, but before we do so, is there anything in this room that might be
      of value to us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hastily, the three searched. A charred mass in the grate indicated that
      Mrs. Vandemeyer had been burning papers on the eve of her flight. Nothing
      of importance remained, though they searched the other rooms as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; said Tuppence suddenly, pointing to a small, old-fashioned
      safe let into the wall. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for jewellery, I believe, but there might be
      something else in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The key was in the lock, and Julius swung open the door, and searched
      inside. He was some time over the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tuppence impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause before Julius answered, then he withdrew his head and
      shut to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In five minutes a brisk young doctor arrived, hastily summoned. He was
      deferential to Sir James, whom he recognized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heart failure, or possibly an overdose of some sleeping-draught.&rdquo; He
      sniffed. &ldquo;Rather an odour of chloral in the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tuppence remembered the glass she had upset. A new thought drove her to
      the washstand. She found the little bottle from which Mrs. Vandemeyer had
      poured a few drops.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been three parts full. Now&mdash; <i>it was empty</i>.
